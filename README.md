Reddit bot that replies to comments that contain a University of Toronto course code with information regarding the course.

Feel free to fork this if you would like to provide this service to your own University's subreddit.

You will need to create a Firebase (free) https://firebase.google.com/ and a reddit account for your bot.

When you've done this you can replace the config.py and adminsdk.json files as needed.

Then, just modify the web scraping and regex portions of coursebot.py and you should be good to go =]
